            We live in a world of instant gratification and time has been compressed when it comes to achieving goals,
            it always feel like many of us aren't achieving goals, creating, building skills or progressing or not just
            busy enough, it is actually motivating but it has its own downsides, as we all can agree; being busy is
            synonymous to being successful in the eyes of society, it is associated with being in demand and being
            popular, basically it is associated with having a figured out career and it isn't easy to let the feeling
            and the dopamine rewards go, when you find yourself using the I'm busy tactic on yourself and people.
            <br>
            <br> 
            So what are the reasons that make us feel busy even if we are not?
            <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; STATUS
            <br>
            As aforementioned society has built a misconception, we all feel someone is busy and thus, definitely
            successful, right? And we all don't want to feel or be seen as unwanted, not in demand and a failure, we
            want to satisfy ourselves in feeling we are in demand by feeling and acting all busy and stressed even by
            little tasks. It is not easy to give up the feeling but it is actually better to be truly busy with true
            work than having a beautiful lie for dopamine rewards and society's approval.
            <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; UNCERTAINTY
            <br>
            I experienced this, there was a time i wanted to build a skill so bad and i had no mentor and i did not look
            for guides from fields of interest (you see that plural “fields” i wasn't sure about the field), i jumped
            from Frontend development to Cloud to Animation to drop shipping to Affiliate marketing e.t.c. I was
            entirely unfocused and I kept telling myself that I'm busy learning skills; a beautiful lie that made me
            feel busy, I felt I was about to become in demand and I felt comfortable enough to not do actually busy
            stuff. The uncertainty of career can make us become busy without actually being busy in places/fields that
            we are not sure about (it is just like wasting our busyness).
            <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; NUMBING
            <br>
            Most of us have once directed our break up pain into doing something? It is actually a mechanism we use to
            avoid thinking about the pain, to numb us away from it, to not have time to think about it but what if you
            don't have a task/work/busy stuff to put the pain into? Well, I guess we deliberately create one just to get
            away from the ache even if it is just a big waste of our time. You keep being busy and at that wasting time
            that could actually be used for true busyness.
            <br>
            <br>
            Being busy isn't bad but glorifying busyness has its own effects. Being busy actually sucks; it is
            inadequate sleep, loneliness, little socializing and sometimes even depressing but if you have to be busy
            then be truly busy; no beautiful lies, no self trickery and status shouldn't be the major push, find a
            purpose.
