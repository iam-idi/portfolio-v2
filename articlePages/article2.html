            <span class="heading">Scenario 1 </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Many good friends of mine have been asking me (OK, even the bad friends of mine) "where have you been?" or
            "what happened to your phone?", and... The thing is that i traveled to the past and a dinosaur ate my phone.
            Alright, you don't believe me, if not because of your trust issues i would have stopped here. But...
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="heading">Scenario 2: A detailing and an extrapolation of scenario 1</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I traveled to Ethiopia (not using the DeLorian and definitely not Rick's portal gun) and Ethiopia uses a
            different calendar from most part of the world, they use the Ge'ez calendar (Ethiopian calendar) which has a
            7 years difference from the Gregorian calendar. The Ethiopians are currently in 2015 (these guys celebrate
            new year every September 11, they call it "the gift of jewels", the Americans probably hate this.) this
            complication arised to an extent due to the unknown true birth date of Jesus. Right, you thought it was 25
            December, i could have told Pope Julius 1 that it isn't cool to assume someone's birth date but he is dead.
            Back to my story... I then went to the Bora amusement park in Addis Ababa and got on a Ferris wheel, which
            made me thought of death and eventually i dropped my phone into the mouth of a bizzare looking electric
            dinosaur and it crushed it .
            <span class="factBox">Fun fact: All birds are descendants of dinosaurs, hence, it won't be wrong to tell
                your next date that she/he is about to eat a T-rex on your next dinner date.
            </span>
            <span class="sci-observe">
                Scientific Observation: Do you think Heihei; that dumb chicken from Moana is also a descendant of the
                giant
                and amazing dinosaurs?
            </span>
            The End.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are still wondering when i went to Ethiopia, your trust issues that got you dumped still thinks I'm
            lying... Ok...
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="heading">Scenario 3: A psychological and philosophical assessment of scenario 2</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            After all the events that unfold i woke up from sleep, it turns out i never really went to Ethiopia, it was
            the trickery of my brain, it was trying to make me not feel bad for my lost phone by making me have an
            unlucid dream of alternate dead of my phone.
            <span class="sci-observe">
                Fun fact: Our thoughts/brain information travels between neurons at a maximum speed of 431.304 km/h and
                the
                fastest human spacecraft; the Parker solar probe travels at an amazing speed of 586,800 km/h, fast
                enough to
                travel from Nigeria to USA under a minute.
            </span>
            Ok, All I'm trying to simply say is my phone got crashed and your's may too (say the God forbid).
