        <p>
            School has been one of the oldest institution of the human civilisation, it has worked efficiently in
            educating people. But what changed? First, the system is as old as our earliest civilization and the school
            system was created for an archaic era, also it has undergone very little, unnoticeable change throughout
            centuries (You can't use an Abacus to solve a problem of quantum entanglement), knowledge and information
            has grown so far away from the reach of schools, but yet, school remains constantly stagnant and this has
            made it wither with time.
            School is an alpha system in a comfort zone with zero competition, hence, it feels no need for improvement.
            <br>
            <br>
            At our present time of exponential human development, young impactful minds who are victims of a stagnant
            system, have come up with different alternatives to our present dominating ancestral system.
            My makaranta.ng is one of these revolutionizing platforms that is eliminating the major challenges affecting
            public schools, thus affecting the major chunk of Nigeria's educational sector. Some of these challenges
            that are being eliminated by My makaranta.ng are: <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; Classroom Size <br>
            The governemt approved standard for secondary school classroom requires a maximum of 35 students and a
            standard classroom should provide an average floor space of 1.2m<sup>2</sup> per student.
            this is a major problem because students are a million times more than the classrooms in secondary schools
            across Nigeria, but My makaranta.ng is eliminating this cancer by providing a system where you could learn
            at your convenience and at your preferred location after conventional school hours. <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; Expensiveness <br>
            The school system has become a lucrative enterprise with little quality control checks by authority, this
            has made standard schooling become expensive, comparatively My maakaranta.ng is offering a platform that
            will provide standard education and knowldege at a dime.
            It is unbelievable that the major materials used by teachers to teach students is still chalk and
            chalkboard, with the present technological outburst secondary schools should have visual display units,
            school management softwares, A fully functional and active ICT lab etc. for efficent, stress free and time
            saving teaching and learning.
            My makaranta.ng is providing a software which is both online and offline with routine updates so as to be
            accessible everywhere with no rural hinderance. <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; Parental involvement <br>
            Extensive research has shown that students achieve more academically when their parents are involved in
            their education, therefore, the more intensively involved parents are, the greater the positive impact and
            academic achievement, with these at heart, My makaranta.ng is providing the space that will facilitate
            optimum parental involvement. The convenient accessibility of My makaranta.ng will aid in eliminating any
            time clash between parental engagement and student's academic activities. <br>
            <br>
            At the age of technological breakthroughs and exponential growth, schools should be optimized to deliver
            exellence. My makaranta.ng is not a system that is coined to replace school, but it is a platform that is
            meant to upgrade and match the standard of education and acquiring knowledge of developed international
            societies.
